# MAITRI AI - Simple Model Architecture

## 🎯 What Does MAITRI Do?

MAITRI detects astronaut emotions using **2 AI models**:
1. **Facial Model** - Analyzes face images (70% accuracy)
2. **Speech Model** - Analyzes voice audio (80% accuracy)
3. **Combined** - Uses both together (85% accuracy)

## 😊 Facial Model (Simple Version)

### Architecture:
```
INPUT: 48x48 face image
    ↓
LAYER 1: Find edges & shapes (64 filters)
    ↓
LAYER 2: Find face parts (128 filters)
    ↓
LAYER 3: Find expressions (256 filters)
    ↓
LAYER 4: Combine features (512 filters)
    ↓
OUTPUT: 7 emotions with confidence
```

**Specs:** 25 MB, <50ms, 65-70% accuracy

---

## 🎤 Speech Model (Simple Version)

### Architecture:
```
INPUT: 3 sec voice audio
    ↓
STEP 1: Extract MFCC features (100x40)
    ↓
STEP 2: Analyze with LSTM (memory network)
    ↓
STEP 3: Detect emotion patterns
    ↓
OUTPUT: 8 emotions with confidence
```

**Specs:** 50 MB, <100ms, 75-80% accuracy

---

## 🔗 Combined System

```
Facial: Happy (87%)  ┐
                     ├─→ FUSION → Happy (89%)
Speech: Happy (82%)  ┘
```

**Result:** More accurate and reliable!
